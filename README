Date Deleted Column Plugin for Nautilus
---------------------------------------

This is mostly a proof-of-concept for showing the deletion date for trash
in Nautilus. Due to the limits of the nautilus plugin system, the date is
shown and sorted as a simple string, rather than as a date.

This plugin now also provides a column for the other trash information:
original location.

You will need the python bindings for creating Nautilus plugins, e.g.,

  sudo aptitude install python-nautilus

Then, put the file date-deleted-column.py in ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/
and restart Nautilus.
